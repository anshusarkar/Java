In java and in some other languages like C++ and Rust Generics are a way of staticaly declaring the type or the type of class, methods

or any kind of the structures or adstructs that the language supports. For example Interface and adstruct class in Java .

(Don't confuse generics with the return type declasration of C, you know " int func(var, var1){return var}"  where int is the return type of 

variable var  ).


In summary the generics are the way of implecitly declaring the "Data types of an abstract i.e. classes or methods". 

mostly used to specify the data types for Arraylist of java.utill pacakages 

Generics are called Templets in C++ BTW
